a scanner takes in source code text as input, ignoring the comments and invalid whitespace, then outputs tokens
a parser takes in the tokens and combine them in a grammar tree called an abstract syntax tree (AST)
the parser reports syntax errors
the parser is then statically analysed. variable names are resolved. scope rules are enforced. types are checked.
type errors are reported here.

that is the frontend of the compiler
